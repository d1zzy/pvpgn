# This file is used to compute the XP points gained/lost by Warcraft III
# anonymous matchmaking games
#
# <min realm level> <level diff> <higher points gained> <higher points lost> <lower points gained> <lower points lost>
#
# Note: you may notice that blizzard has columns for points win/loss by
# higher and lower opponets but because they must keep constant the sum
# of points the columns are in "mirror"

# used for all players
