# This file can be used to define shortcuts for often-used commands or for   #
# unusually long commands.  It can also be used to make custom emotes which  #
# are especially useful for non-English servers.                             #
#                                                                            #
# Lines starting with a # are considered to be comments.                     #
# The format is:                                                             #
# @                                                                          #
# aliasname [aliasshortcut1 [aliasshortcut2 [...]]]                          #
# [!]text or command to type as if the player typed it                       #
# [!]%Iinformation to print to the player                                    #

# Where ! is either an integer representing the number of arguments given to #
# the alias by the user or an asterisk (*) meaning it will match any number  #
# of arguments.  The plus sign (+) will match with any non-zero number of    #
# arguments.                                                                 #
#                                                                            #
# There may be as many lines as you want following the aliasname.  If        #
# multiple lines match they will be executed in the order they are listed.   #
#                                                                            #
# The text or command is actually formatted text as used in the bnmotd file. #
# It contains special formatting characters which can be used to specify the #
# type of message or substitue special values (the hostname, the player's    #
# own name, and many more).  These all start with a percent sign (%).  There #
# are also special formatters which subsitute arguments which were entered   #
# by the user.  These start with a dollar sign.                              #
#                                                                            #
# $*             -  substitute all arguments here                            #
# $0 through $9  -  substitute that argument here (0 means the command)      #
# ${43}          -  substitute that argument here (0 means the command)      #
# ${-19}         -  substitute arguments 0-19 here                           #
# ${2-}          -  substitue all arguments from 2 until the end here        #
#                                                                            #
