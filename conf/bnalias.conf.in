# This file can be used to define shortcuts for often-used commands or for   #
# unusually long commands.  It can also be used to make custom emotes which  #
# are especially useful for non-English servers.                             #
#                                                                            #

# Where ! is either an integer representing the number of arguments given to #
# the alias by the user or an asterisk (*) meaning it will match any number  #
# of arguments.  The plus sign (+) will match with any non-zero number of    #
# arguments.                                                                 #

# There may be as many lines as you want following the aliasname.  If        #
# multiple lines match they will be executed in the order they are listed.   #

# The text or command is actually formatted text as used in the bnmotd file. #
# It contains special formatting characters which can be used to specify the #
# type of message or substitue special values (the hostname, the player's    #
# own name, and many more).  These all start with a percent sign (%).  There #
# are also special formatters which subsitute arguments which were entered   #
# by the user.  These start with a dollar sign.                              #
