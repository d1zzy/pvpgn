	     		   D2Pack 1.09
			  -------------

    PvPGN is a BNETD mod which aims to provide support for all Blizzard 
clients (thus it supports all BNETD supported clients plus the most recent 
ones). 
    This release only includes d2cs/d2dbs as needed to host a Diablo II 1.09 
closed realm. It only supports d2gs 1.09d. This package NEEDS a "bnetd" server 
configured to work (for example use a "bnetd" from a PvPGN release).

The list of supported clients and their minimum verion required is:
- Diablo 2 v1.09 
- Diablo 2 LOD v1.09 
------------

    The documentation is located in the docs directory. Please read docs/INDEX 
for a list of files and what they contain.
    If you are updating from a previous PvPGN version check the file UPDATE 
first.
