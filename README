ones). 
    This release only includes d2cs/d2dbs as needed to host a Diablo II 1.09 
closed realm. It only supports d2gs 1.09d

The list of supported clients and their minimum verion required is:
- Diablo 2 v1.09 
- Diablo 2 LOD v1.09

    The documentation is located in the docs directory. Please read docs/INDEX 
for a list of files and what they contain.
    If you are updating from a previous PvPGN version check the file UPDATE 
first.
