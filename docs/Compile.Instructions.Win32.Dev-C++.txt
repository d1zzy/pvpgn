PvPGN Win32 Dev-C++ Compile Instructions
This file explains how to compile PvPGN for Win32 using Dev-C++ ( 5.0 beta 9 (4.9.9.0) )

1) Download Dev-C++ 5.0 beta 9 (4.9.9.0) with Mingw/GCC 3.3.1 from the folling sites:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp4990setup.exe

2) Install Dev-C++ in a folder without any spaces in the path

3) Go into the Win32-Projects folder of the PvPGN sources
Simply double-click on any of the *.dev files to fire up Dev-C++ and use Execute->Compile to build the binary

3) The resulting exe file will be in the bin directory and you can use it with the other files from the latest PvPGN release.

Notes for MYSQL Support:
mySQL support with Dev-C++ still unsupported/untested

Notes for GUI Support:
We won't support building a GUI version with Dev-C++

Common problems and Solutions:
==============================

Fatal: 'all-before' does not exist - don't know how to make it:
----------------------------------------------------------------
That happens when the wrong make.exe is invoked, usually the Borland one. It will usually leave a copyright notice in your compile log.
How to fix it? add the bin folder of your Dev-C++ (or MinGW) installation to the PATH environment variable, before any Borland path that might be there

Complains about not being able to create Makefile or 'no rule to make target all':
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check size of pvpgn\src\win32\Makefile.win
If it's 0 bytes quit Dev-C++, delete the file and try to compile again
