	PvPGN Install instructions for the Linux/Unix version
       -------------------------------------------------------

1. First get your hands on a PvPGN source tarball or a binary package (RPM/etc).
If you got the source follow instructions bellow, if you got a binary package 
jump to step 4

2. Unpack the tarball, change current directory to the source directory (ex. 
pvpgn-<version>/src) and run configure. You will need to provide configure with 
your custom options, ex.

./configure --prefix=<path>

It will configure the source distribution to compile and install in the <path> 
location.

Check using ./configure --help for all available options.

3. Compile and install PvPGN using

$ make
$ make install

WARNING !! make install it will also overwrite the configuration files. Make a 
backup of them before doing "make install" (read more about this in the UPDATE 
file).

Now you just need to edit the config files and adjust them acording to your 
system. Have fun!

4. (only for binary PvPGN distributions)
Depending on the type of package you have obtained (ex RPM, deb, tgz) you will 
have to install the package using the right package tool.

Examples:

$ rpm -ivh pvpgn-<ver>.rpm

or

$ installpkg pvpgn-<ver>.tgz

or

$ dpkg -i pvpgn-<ver>.deb

After you install the binary package you will need to adjust PvPGN configuration 
files (usually installed in /etc/pvpgn dir). Have fun!
