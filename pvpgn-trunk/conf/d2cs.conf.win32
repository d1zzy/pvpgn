# This is a comma delimited list of hostnames that the server should
# listen on.  Generally, YOU DONT NEED TO TOUCH THIS but it might be useful 
# to make an internal-only server on a gateway machine for example.  If the 
# list is not set or if it has a entry with no host component, the server will 
# bind to that port on all interfaces.
# d2cs default listening port is 6113

# (if you have a d2gs running on a machine with the IP 192.168.1.10)
