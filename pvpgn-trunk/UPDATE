    field used to fix a MAJOR bug that shows up with case sensitive SQL engines

    to specify the address to listen for WOL clients, woltimezone for the 
    server timezone to send to clients, wollong for the server longitute, 
    wollat for the server latitude
- conf/bnetd.conf : changed "servaddrs" directive to not be totally commented 
    and be as ":" by default in bnetd.conf (if "servaddrs" is commented this 
    means "bnetd" will not listen for b.net services at all)

    SC/BW 1.13 and 1.13b)

    matching gamename to be counted as ladder (applies only to alternative 
    ladder game types as specified by "ladder_games" directive)

 Updating from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2
==============================

    saved to disk on user's logoff

    d2cs can delete the backup copy of charactars deleted by the client.

 Updating from 1.6.x to 1.7.0
==============================

Because of the many changes in 1.7.0 we recommend to use a clean install 
and update the configuration files as necesarry. Things to note:
1. you now need GNU make to build PvPGN on POSIX systems (on Linux this is 
just "make" but on *BSD is "gmake")
2. d2trans,gametrans,w3trans have been unified under address_translation.conf 
file which has a complete new syntax so take care with that
